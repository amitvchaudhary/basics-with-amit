# What Is ExpressJS?

According to the officials [ExpressJS Website](https://expressjs.com/), Express is a Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js

## Why Use ExpressJS?

Here are some of the features of express

- Web Applications

  - Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

- APIs

  - With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy.

- Performance

  - Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features that you know and love.

- Frameworks
  - Many [popular frameworks](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/frameworks.html) are based on Express.

## Getting Started

We will need ot create a new folder that will host our express app. We will also need to install afew packages.

create a new folder and cd into it

```bash
mkdir express-app && cd express-app
```

Initialize the project with `npm init`

```bash
npm init -y
```

Install these packages with npm

```bash
npm install express cors dotenv
```

We will also use apackage called `nodemon` to restart our app when we make file changes

```bash
npm install -D nodemon
```

## Creating a Server

Creating a server is as simple as creating a file called `server.js` and adding the following code to it.

```elixir
Eshell V13.0.4  (abort with ^G)
1> c(module_name).
ok
1> module_name:hello().
Hello world!
ok
```

Hello [World]{.bg-blue-500}!

```json
{
  "data": {
    "greeting": "Hello GraphQL From TutorialsPoint !!"
  }
}
```

Now If we visit the app in our browser at https://localhost:3000, we will see the following output

```html
<div>Hello World!</div>
```
