Phoenix LiveView
::

I have been a frontend developer for long time and used all major frameworks like React, Vue, Anuglar, NextJS, Svelte, Remix, Astro, etc. When I came across Phoenix LiveView article, when it was introduced in 2018, I just skimmed the content and didn't give much time to try and test as other frontend frameworks were already capable of doing wonderful things. But in 2021, when I was building a custom chatbot with tech stack ReactJS, GraphQL, Web Socket, Python, NodeJS, Postgres, etc, I hit a performance roadblock. The real issue was concurrent connections, backend could support about 30,000 connections per second with multiple servers running on cloud. I was not happy with the overall solution. Then in 2022, I came across LiveView again and this was the time when I started learning Elixir with more interest. This time, I was already convinced that LiveView is capable of replacing all the existing SPA and SSR frameworks. At the time of writing this article, I would say NextJS/Remix/Astro all are trying to get best of both SPA and SSR worlds with hybrid approach. I personally like _island architecture_ in Astro where you can populate portions of the UI dynamically.
