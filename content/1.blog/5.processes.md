If you have just started learning Elixir, then you must have read about LiveView components. They are super powerful and I believe they will replace React/Angular/VueJS one day. I claim this because I have used all aforementioned frameworks for quite a long time and I strongly feel, Elixir LiveView will be the future for frontend development. But before you accept what I just said and start creating new project, I suggest you to understand this post thoroughly. This doesn't mean you can't start with LiveView without reading this post, but if you know what goes under the hood, you will appreciate its architecture and design decisions. In this post we are NOT going to talk about LiveView, but what powers it - **Process**.

Every business person wants his product (system) to run for 24x7 and make his customers happy. But this wish can only be fulfilled if the system fulfills below parameters:

- _Fault-tolerance_: Recover from the effects of runtime errors.
- _Scalability_: Handle increase in requests by adding more hardware resources, but not redeploying the code.
- _Distribution_: If one server fails, another takes over the work

You might have read above terms with respect to **Cloud Computing**. It's because in cloud, the cloud provider takes care of them. But it doesn't come for free. You need to pay. Sometimes, even after spending good amount of money, business owners or backend developers can't do much due to poor choice of backend language. But what if I tell you, from my own experience, that you can reduce your billing if you use Elixir? It sounds lucrative and it is. The reason for that is again a **Process**.

In this post, when I say _Process_, I mean BEAM Process and NOT an OS process. BEAM is a Virtual Machine that runs the processes. The BEAM process is way lighter than OS process. In fact whole BEAM runs on a single OS process. You must be knowing that OS process can spawn multiple **threads** to achieve concurrency. So, it means a thread is lighter than an OS process. But BEAM process is so light that it takes couple of microseconds to create and just few KBs as compared to OS thread which takes couple of megabytes even just for the stack. It is said that BEAM VM can spawn roughly 134 million processes. :open_mouth: :open_mouth:

You can see in the above diagram that how one OS process has four OS threads running BEAM schedulers. The no. of schedulers depend on the no. of OS threads. If you have 4-core machine, then you can have four OS threads which can handle four BEAM schedulers. A scheduler is in charge of the interchangeable execution of processes. Each process gets some time; after the time is up, the running process is preempted, and the next one takes over.
